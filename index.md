## What is Hypercoagulation?

Hypercoagulation is when proteins in the body starts forming clots. When the clots become too much this becomes a blood clot. Blood clots can cause many health problems from numerous heart diseases to even death.

### How does it relate to COVID-19?

Due to the hospitals around the country and the world due to COVID-19 doctors have restrictions when it comes to patientcare. The only way a doctor can test for hypercoagulation for COVID-19 patients is to take a blood sample. However, taking a blood sample puts an increasing risk on doctors to contract COVID-19. This is causing COVID-19 patients to have an increase chance of dying from hypercoagulation due to the lack of frequent blood testing. HemoChek allows doctors to examine a patient's blood level through an app once connected to the hemolyzer. Through our app doctor's can check for multiple patient's blood level on the go!
